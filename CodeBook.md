# CodeBook for the dataset wear_sum_mean.csv

The final product is a tidy data set summarising certain physical quantities in the [UCI HAR dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), and the following codebook is in reference to that data set. 

1. The activity labels have been changed from numbers 1-6, to that in activity_labels.txt, and only the columns that represent the mean or standard deviation of a particular physical quantity are selected, and these variables are given their appropriate names, as in variables_wear.txt. 

2. The data set wear is the final product which is a tidy data set that is arranged by the subject number, grouped by subject and activity, and the variables are the means of all the concerned variables.
