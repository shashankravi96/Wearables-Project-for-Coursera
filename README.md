# Wearables Project
### A project for the course Getting and Cleaning Data. A part of the Data Science Specialization by John Hopkins University.
 
The script runanalysis.R takes in the folder path to the [UCI HAR dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) on your computer, and combines the testing and training data sets, and "tidies" it up along with giving the means of columns that provide means or standard deviations per activity per subject. 

It also gives appropriate names to the activities and variable names and combines different datasets spread throughout the folder to form the final product. Commentary on how it does so is provided in the script itself.
